# For cross-compiling on arm64 Linux using gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu package:

#   $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../dynamorio/make/toolchain-arm64.cmake ../dynamorio
# You may have to set CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH to point to the target enviroment, e.g.
# by passing -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu on Debian-like systems.
